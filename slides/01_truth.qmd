# Truth

## Warm-Up


Make at least 3 observations about the following table:

::::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}

| p | q | p ∨ q |
|---|---|:--------:|
| F | F |   F    |
| F | T |   T    |
| T | F |   T    |
| T | T |   T    |

:::

::: {.column width="70%"}

## Summary

Key observations about the table:

::::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}

| p | q | p ∨ q |
|---|---|:--------:|
| F | F |   F    |
| F | T |   T    |
| T | F |   T    |
| T | T |   T    |

:::

::: {.column style="width: 70%; font-size: 80%;"}

*   The diagram is called a _Truth Table_
*   p and q are _variables_, each of which take on one of two _Boolean_ values, True or False (T/F, 1/0) 
*   ∨ is a _binary operator_ that implements a function (creates output) from the 2 input variables to another Boolean value. It is characterized by its output values.
*   The operator ∨ corresponds to the English word _or_. 
*   The expression p ∨ q is called a _proposition_.

## Truth Tables

Some questions to ponder:

::::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}

| p | q | p ∨ q |
|---|---|:--------:|
| F | F |   F    |
| F | T |   T    |
| T | F |   T    |
| T | T |   T    |

:::

::: {.column style="width: 70%;"}

*   How many rows for a proposition on 3 variables? _k_ variables?


*   Give a good name for an operator that takes 1 variable: __________


*   Give a good name for an operator that takes 3 variables: __________


*   How many different binary operators could there be?

## Truth Tables

All graded learning activities in the course will use a tool called _PrairieLearn_.

## Beyond Operators

_Propositions_ can be more complex than just a single operator! 

Example:


| p | q | ~(p ∨ q) |
|---|---|:--------:|
| F | F |   T    |
| F | T |   F    |
| T | F |   F    |
| T | T |   F    |

## WFFs

A _well-formed formula_ is a Boolean statement generated by the following rules:

```{bnf}
<wff> ::= <atom>
        | ~ <wff>
        | ( <wff> ∧ <wff> )
        | ( <wff> ∨ <wff> )

<atom> ::= p | q | r | s | ...

```

Speculate:

## WFFs

A _well-formed formula_ is a Boolean statement generated by the following rules:

```{bnf}
<wff> ::= <atom>
        | ~ <wff>
        | ( <wff> ∧ <wff> )
        | ( <wff> ∨ <wff> )

<atom> ::= p | q | r | s | ...

```

This definition is in the form of a _Grammar_. 

_____________: `<wff>` and `<atom>`

_____________: `p`, `q`, `r`, `s` ...

It is our first self-referential or _recursive_ definition. 

## WFFs

```{bnf}
<wff> ::= <atom>
        | ~ <wff>
        | ( <wff> ∧ <wff> )
        | ( <wff> ∨ <wff> )

<atom> ::= p | q 

```
Example derivation:

`<wff>`

## WFFs (Notes)

```{bnf}
<wff> ::= <atom>
        | ~ <wff>
        | ( <wff> ∧ <wff> )
        | ( <wff> ∨ <wff> )

<atom> ::= p | q 

```

* Grammars can be used to construct _many_ different sequences. 

* We could have included additional operators $\rightarrow$, $\leftrightarrow$, $\oplus$, $\uparrow$

* Computational evaluation of `<wff>`is covered in DSCI221. For now, we trust Python and focus on logic.

* The `<wff>` are _propositions_. 

## Logical Equivalence

\

Ex: Is it true that $(p \lor q) \equiv (q\lor p)$ ?

\

Discussion points:

* $\equiv$ means _logically equivalent_

* The answer had better be <b>YES!</b>

* How can we justify our instinct?
